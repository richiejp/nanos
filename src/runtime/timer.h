typedef struct timer *timer;

/* On timer expiration, the registered timer handler will be invoked with the
   associated timer expiry and a count of timer overruns (or a value of
   timer_disabled (-1ull) if the timer was canceled; see below). The expiry
   value may be used by the handler to track a number of events without the
   need to allocate a separate handler for each event.

   An overruns value of timer_disabled indicates that a timer has been
   canceled. Every timer registration must result in at least one callback:
   for one-shot timers, there is a terminal callback for either timer
   expiration or cancellation. Periodic timers will run indefinitely until
   canceled, with the last callback signalling timer_disabled. Therefore, a
   timer handler may be deallocated only on one of these terminal conditions,
   and not simply after a call to remove_timer(). Naturally, if multiple
   timers are registered for the same handler, even if for the same expiry
   (which is valid and will be treated as multiple expiration events), the
   handler must keep track of these registrations and only deallocate the
   handler and associated resources after the last terminal callback.
